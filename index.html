        <p class="para">I love to read, whether its nonfiction or fiction, picture story or chapter I dont care. I will read any book and I especially love reading harry potter because it is put in so much detail and the adventures harry, ron, and hermione get into are unimaginable. like in harry potter and the pholosphers stone harry has to try stop Prefesor Quirel from getting the stone that will bring lord voldemort back to life or like in chamber of secrets were harry has to stop tom riddle or voldemort from killing him with the baslik but they are all equally awesome and I still read those books to this day and when I finish a book I get to watch the movie which makes it a win-win.
